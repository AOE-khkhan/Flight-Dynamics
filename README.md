# Flight Dynamics Assignment

# (1) Analytical Model
#           - Simple!!!
#           - Equations from slides + Parameters from Appendix C1-C3
# (2) Numerical Model
#           - Linear Model from Appendix C
#           - Create continuous state-space form (Appendix D)
#           - Calculate response to inputs
# ***** For (1) and (2) Appendix C is used *****
# (3) Data Processing
#           - First stationary measurement [C_L v C_D, C_L_alpha, C_D_alpha]
#           - Second stationary measurement (How to thrust: App. C, Normalizing: App. B) [C_m_alpha: from trim curve, C_m_delta: shift in c.g.] -> For both stick free and stick fixed
